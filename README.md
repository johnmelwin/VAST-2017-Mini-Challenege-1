## 1. Introduction 📖
<span style="color:darkred">The Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve, visited by local
residents and tourists faces an important challenge. There
are signs indicating a decrease in the number of nesting
pairs of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit, a bird cherished for its
attractive feathers and melodious songs. There could be some
odd vehicle behaviours that seem inconsistent with typical
park visitation patterns which might affect the birds. This
study aims to analyze these vehicle behaviors over time,
shedding light on whether and how they might be disrupting
the preserve’s delicate ecosystem.</span>
