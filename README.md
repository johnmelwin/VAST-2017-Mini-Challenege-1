## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between vehicle traffic patterns and wildlife health within the Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve, specifically focusing on the impact on the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit bird species. The purpose is to unravel the effects of human vehicular activity on the preserve's delicate ecological balance. This was achieved by addressing three key research questions: identifying predominant traffic flow patterns within the preserve, defining unusual vehicle behaviors, and exploring the correlation between these factors and changes in the local bird population. The study's outcomes are expected to inform and influence future policies and actions aimed at protecting the Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve's diverse ecosystem, ensuring a sustainable coexistence of human and natural elements.

## 1. Introduction
The Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve, visited by local residents and tourists, faces an important challenge. There are signs indicating a decrease in the number of nesting pairs of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit, a bird cherished for its attractive feathers and melodious songs. There could be some odd vehicle behaviors that seem inconsistent with typical park visitation patterns which might affect the birds. This study aims to analyze these vehicle behaviors over time, shedding light on whether and how they might be disrupting the preserve's delicate ecosystem.

## 2. Research Questions
To strategically analyze this situation, we have formulated three research questions to arrive at a reasonable solution. The answers to these questions will serve as a solution to the challenge. The research questions are as follows:
1. What are the predominant traffic flow patterns within the Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve?
2. What constitutes unusual vehicle behaviors within the Preserve?
3. How does vehicle data correlate with bird population changes, indicating human impact on avian habitats?

## 3. Dataset
To address this challenge, two key data sources are utilized: Firstly, an extensive csv file with sensor-recorded vehicle movements in the Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve, detailing timestamps, unique vehicle IDs, types of vehicles, and the specific gates and sensors they pass. Secondly, a map of the Preserve, visually depicting a 200x200 grid area, showcasing roads, sensor placements, and important zones within the Preserve. The dataset is cleaned, pre-processed, and formatted for the analysis.
